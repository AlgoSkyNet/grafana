# Configure Grafana Teams

This  topic describes how to set up and configure Grafana Teams.

## Before you begin

Before you begin creating and working with Grafana Teams:

- Ensure that you have either the `Organization Administrator` role or team administrator permissions. Refer to [Organization roles](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/#organization-roles) and [RBAC permissions, actions, and scopes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/custom-role-actions-scopes/#rbac-permissions-actions-and-scopes) for a list of Grafana roles and role-based access control actions.
- Decide which users belong to which teams and what permissions team members receive.
- Configure the default basic role for users to join Grafana. This role is applied to users where no role is set by the identity provider (IDP)
  - No basic role - by default cannot view any resources - recommended for isolated teams
  - Viewer role - by default can view all resources - recommended for collaborative teams
- Ensure team sync is turned on if you plan to manage team members through team sync. Refer to [Configure Team Sync](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-team-sync/)  for  a list of providers and instructions on how to turn on team sync for each provider.
- Turn on nested folders.  __This is a new feature.__

## Create a Grafana Team
