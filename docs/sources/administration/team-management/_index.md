# Grafana Teams

Grafana Teams makes it easy to organize and administer groups of users in your enterprise. Teams allows you to grant permissions to a group of users instead of granting permissions to individual users one at a time.

Teams are useful in a wide variety of scenarios, such as when onboarding new colleagues or needing access to report on secure financial data. When you add a user to a team, they get access to all resources assigned to that team.
